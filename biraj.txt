My name is Biraj.
Here are few of the commands to get started with GitHub :

1) git clone <repository url> 			//clones git repository in local storage 		(local)
2) git status 					//gives the status of the local commits (i guess) 	(local)
3) git add . (or -all or filename) 		//confirms new file added on local storage 		(local)
4) git commit -m "message" 			//this saves your new files locally 			(local)
5) git push					//pushes files to your online git repository 		(remote)
6) git pull					//pulls files from online repository 			(remote)

Before the step 5 you can send pull request to the owner of the repository via web.
Thank you.
